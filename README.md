## Description

Just Another Text Editor (JATE) allows for users to have a text editor directly in their browser that is available offline and as a Progressive Web Application (PWA). Users can install the PWA for working offline, and their work will automatically be synced to the browser once they come back online.

## Installation

To install the PWA, look for an icon that looks like this:

Alternatively, click the "Install!" button in the top left corner of the browser window.

## Usage

Navigate to https://cac-jate.herokuapp.com/ to begin. The text editor is formatted similarly to many other programming IDEs. Start a new line by clicking under the JATE logo. Your progress will be saved automatically even if you close the tab or click off to a different window.
